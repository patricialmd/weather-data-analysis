# Weather Data Analysis

## Project Overview
Analysed 13,843 weather rows of data using Python to classify temperature levels. My aim was to identify whether temperature can be correctly predicted using environmental factors like pressure, precipitation, radiation, and seasonal indicators.

## Key Findings
I built a multiclass classification model using Logistic Regression in Python to predict daily mean temperatures, achieving 77.54% accuracy on 2,769 weather records using feature selection to identify optimal predictors.
* Achieved 75% binary classification accuracy for High vs. Low mean temperatures
* Achieved 77% accuracy for multiclass classification (Low, Moderate, High)
* Determined cloud cover, gobal radiation, and month as primary predictors.
* Observed strong seasonal patterns reflected in model coefficients
* Temperature categories showed imbalanced distributions (Moderate being the largest class)

## Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression
